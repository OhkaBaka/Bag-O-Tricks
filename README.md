Bag-O-Tricks
============

This is a collection of my various little bits.

Contextual Contains Filter
--------------------------
Provides option to contextually filter Views by search terms INCLUDED in a field, instead of EQUAL TO. This started life as [RdeBoer's](https://drupal.org/user/404007) work [Views Contextual Range Filter](https://drupal.org/project/contextual_range_filter)

Screen Shot Feed
----------------
As a challenge I was asked to create a UI control that could display images from a feed and alert the user as new images came in. [See it In Action](http://trulove.cc/Bag-O-Tricks/screenshotfeed/)

Towers of Hanoi
---------------
In an interview I was asked to procedurally solve a Towers of Hanoi challenge, this is the result. [See it In Action](http://trulove.cc/Bag-O-Tricks/towersofhanoi/towers.php)

eatImage
--------
The idea was not a wise one, but it was an interesting one.
"How hard would it be to feed an image to PHP, disect it into colors and coordinates, and then reconstruct it using DOM elements."

turnImage
---------
JavaScript can't natively do certain things. Image rotation is one of those things. TurnImage is a javascript solution to flipping an image on it's Y axis. [See it In Action](http://trulove.cc/Bag-O-Tricks/turnImage/)

phpadv
------
I needed a model to work on OOP inside of PHP.  I chose an adventure game as an excellent collection of objects that can be extended into other objects and other types of objects. 

GEngHIS
-------
GEngHIS needs love.  It is the culmination of various ideas and projects that all supported this idea that you could build an old school 8-Bit style adventure game using JS.  I keep it in here because it had some great bits of my early excursions into **big** JS, and some bits that could be pulled out and made into new things, as soon as I have the need for them.

usgs2kml
--------
For about 6 months, a few years back, was Google Maps integration.  One of my favorite tools that could outline geographical bodies on a google map.
Built in ColdFusion, and using USGS data.
The reason it sticks around is as a reminder not to try to build things if there is a chance Google is already doing it.  They will finish before you, do a better job, and make you look like an amateur.
